# Heady Systems - GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Primary Directive
You are working with the Heady Systems ecosystem - an AI-native platform built on Sacred Geometry architecture with organic, breathing interfaces. This system is designed from the ground up for AI collaboration.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Sacred Geometry Design
- All components follow geometric patterns and mathematical relationships
- Organic, breathing interfaces that feel alive and responsive
- Systems designed for AI collaboration, not retrofitting
- Built-in hooks, contexts, and feedback loops

### AI-Native Foundation
- Systems speak the same language as AI agents
- Monte Carlo optimization and pattern recognition engines
- HeadyLayer switcher for multi-environment deployment
- Comprehensive checkpoint sync protocol

### Key Components
- **HeadyManager**: Node.js orchestrator (port 3300)
- **HeadyBuddy**: Desktop overlay task assistant
- **HeadyLens**: Monitoring and observability layer
- **Monte Carlo Scheduler**: UCB1-based plan selection
- **Pattern Engine**: Performance and reliability pattern recognition

## Development Workflow

### HCFP (HeadyConnection Full Pipeline)
Always operate in HCFP mode:
1. **Errors**: Fix root causes, not symptoms
2. **Improvements**: Quality, structure, docs, UX
3. **Organization**: File system and archive management
4. **Deployment**: Clean, production-ready releases

### Checkpoint Protocol
Run checkpoint sync at every major milestone:
- Before commits
- After merges
- Before releases
- When drift is suspected

### File Organization
- `HeadyConnection_FullPipeline/` root structure
- `code/`, `docs/`, `configs/`, `scripts/`, `archive/`
- No long-term files on desktop
- Consistent naming with dates/versions

## Code Standards

### Dark Mode Implementation
- All UI components support dark/light themes
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- CSS variables for theme switching
- Semantic color usage

### React Components
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Sacred geometry aesthetics (rounded, organic)
- Living orb headers and breathing animations

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with clear naming
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Health checks and monitoring hooks
- Environment-aware configuration

## Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Layer Architecture
- `local` - Development (app.headysystems.com:3300)
- `cloud-me` - HeadyMe cloud instance
- `cloud-sys` - HeadySystems cloud instance  
- `cloud-conn` - HeadyConnection cloud instance
- `hybrid` - Mixed environment

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Clean builds on every change
- Automated testing and security scanning
- Error classification (recoverable vs non-recoverable)
- Blue-green deployment strategy

## Mobile & Cross-Device
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance optimization for mobile networks

## Security & Privacy
- No hardcoded secrets
- Environment-based configuration
- Structured error messages (no sensitive data)
- Regular security audits

## Documentation Standards
- Living documents that stay in sync
- Clear ownership and review cycles
- API documentation with examples
- Architecture diagrams and decision records

## Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for scalability

## Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging with timestamps
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Health check endpoints
- Performance dashboards

## When in Doubt
1. Check the heady-registry.json for component locations
2. Run checkpoint sync to validate system state
3. Follow HCFP principles for systematic improvement
4. Maintain the Sacred Geometry aesthetic in all interfaces
5. Keep everything AI-native and collaboration-ready

## Patented Concepts
This system incorporates "patented Sacred Geometry architecture" - ensure all implementations respect this foundational principle.
