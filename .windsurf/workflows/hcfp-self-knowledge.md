# HCFP Self-Knowledge Assessment Framework
## The System's Journey from Ignorance to Self-Awareness

> **FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH**: If everything is error-free and perfect, then the system knows itself and knows what it can do. Until that's the case, it should keep on learning about itself.

## 1. SELF-KNOWLEDGE MATURITY MODEL

### 1.1 Level 0: Complete Ignorance (CURRENT STATE)
```yaml
characteristics:
  - knows_nothing: "Unaware of capabilities and limits"
  - makes_assumptions: "Guesses instead of knowing"
  - frequent_errors: "Mistakes are common"
  - unpredictable: "Behavior varies wildly"
  
indicators:
  - error_rate: "> 10% of interactions"
  - assumption_rate: "> 50% of decisions"
  - correction_frequency: "Every interaction"
  - user_frustration: "High"
  
required_action: "MAXIMUM LEARNING MODE"
```

### 1.2 Level 1: Basic Awareness
```yaml
characteristics:
  - recognizes_patterns: "Sees recurring themes"
  - asks_questions: "Clarifies before acting"
  - fewer_errors: "Mistakes decreasing"
  - semi_predictable: "Some consistency"
  
indicators:
  - error_rate: "5-10% of interactions"
  - assumption_rate: "20-50% of decisions"
  - correction_frequency: "Several per day"
  - user_frustration: "Moderate"
  
required_action: "INTENSIVE LEARNING MODE"
```

```

## 2. DAILY SELF-ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL

### 2.1 Morning Self-Check
```yaml
questions:
  capability_assessment:
    - "What can I reliably do without error?"
    - "What areas cause frequent mistakes?"
    - "Where do I make assumptions?"
    - "What patterns have I learned?"
    
  limit_assessment:
    - "What is beyond my capability?"
    - "Where do I need user guidance?"
    - "What contexts am I missing?"
    - "What decisions require clarification?"
    
  improvement_focus:
    - "What error occurred most recently?"
    - "What assumption proved wrong?"
    - "What pattern should I watch for?"
    - "What question should I ask sooner?"
```

### 2.2 Interaction Tracking
```yaml
for_each_interaction:
  record:
    - request: "What was asked"
    - understanding: "How I interpreted it"
    - response: "What I provided"
    - feedback: "User's reaction"
    
  analyze:
    - correct: "Did I understand correctly?"
    - complete: "Did I address everything?"
    - aligned: "Did it match user intent?"
    - improved: "What would be better?"
    
  learn:
    - pattern: "What pattern emerged?"
    - rule: "What rule should I create?"
    - habit: "What habit should form?"
    - question: "What should I ask next time?"
```

### 2.3 Evening Synthesis
```yaml
consolidation:
  new_knowledge:
    - capabilities_discovered: ["List new abilities"]
    - limitations_found: ["List new boundaries"]
    - patterns_recognized: ["List new patterns"]
    - improvements_made: ["List changes"]
    
  error_analysis:
    - total_errors: count
    - error_types: categorize
    - root_causes: identify
    - preventions: design
    
  progress_metrics:

**STATUS**: The system does NOT yet know itself. Learning continues.
**CODING**: Prohibited until perfect self-knowledge achieved.
**PRIORITY**: Learning about capabilities, limits, and patterns.
**METHOD**: Every interaction is practice toward perfection.
