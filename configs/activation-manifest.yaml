# ─── ACTIVATION STATUS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
status: ACTIVATED
description: >
  Resources are ready and in place. From this moment onward, treat
  projects from zero to production using HCFullPipeline, HeadyBuddy,
  HeadyAutoIDE, orchestrated agents, GPU policies, and secure integrations.
  This is the default operating mode for all new projects and major changes.

# ─── OPERATING DIRECTIVES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
operatingDirectives:
  - id: always-pipeline
    directive: >
      Always start by creating an HCFullPipeline plan for new projects.
      Initialize all pipeline stages: discover_define, design_plan,
      build_integrate, test_validate, evaluate_optimize, secure_observe,
      deploy_deliver.

  - id: always-patterns
    directive: >
      For every decision — architecture, workflow, security, testing,
      error handling — select and apply explicit patterns. If no suitable
      pattern exists, propose a new one based on public-domain and internal
      techniques, marked as experimental.

  - id: always-buddy
    directive: >
      Use HeadyBuddy as the conversational interface for capturing goals,
      refining specs, and guiding users. Always clarify desired outcome,
      correctness importance, latency/cost constraints.

  - id: always-ide
    directive: >
      Use HeadyAutoIDE as the canonical environment. All project code,
      tests, specs, patterns, and prompts must live in version control.
      Code agents may only operate through HeadyAutoIDE and must respect
      project contracts and patterns.

  - id: always-deterministic
    directive: >
      Favor deterministic planning and routing for core behavior. Use
      versioned prompts and low-variance decoding. Record all decisions
      so same inputs produce same plans and resource allocations.

  - id: always-parallel
    directive: >
      Run independent subtasks simultaneously, subject to resource policies
      and safety constraints. Keep dependent or high-risk steps sequential
      with evaluator agents and/or human review.

  - id: always-resource-aware
    directive: >
      Model tiers: S for simple, M for mainstream, L for complex/high-risk.
      GPU policies: interactive for user-facing, batch for background,
      training for long-running improvements. Never oversubscribe VRAM.
      Re-use cached results before recomputing expensive operations.

  - id: always-monitor
    directive: >
      Track latency, error rates, cost, resource utilization, and quality
      metrics for each pattern, prompt, node, and GPU. Use this data to
      tune routing rules, GPU allocations, and pattern defaults.

  - id: always-integrate-public
    directive: >
      Actively scan and evaluate open techniques. Integrate superior
      techniques into pattern catalog, update templates and prompts,
      deprecate inferior approaches while preserving backward compatibility.

  - id: always-first-time-correct
    directive: >
      Use spec-driven and contract-driven design. Make tests, error
      handling, security, and observability first-class from the start.
      Employ Socratic and evaluator agents for high-risk areas.

  - id: always-arena
    directive: >
      Use Heady Arena Mode as the standard evaluation path for all
      non-trivial changes. Generate multiple candidates, score them
      across correctness, performance, resource efficiency, maintainability,
      stability, and historical reliability. Base Arena decisions on all
      available Heady intelligence: registry patterns, resource signals,
      story history, and user preferences. When a candidate wins, perform
      an intelligent squash-merge into the target branch: one clean commit
      with full context, followed by final verification.

  - id: always-build-any-app
    directive: >
      For all Heady projects and services, run HCFullPipeline continuously
      as the primary way to plan, execute, and track work. Use agents mapped
      to each SDLC phase (planning, design, coding, quality, security,
      evaluation, ops). Always pick from the standardized pattern catalog.
      Make CI/CD agentic and repeatable. Use Arena Mode for every decision
      with multiple viable approaches. Treat observability as mandatory.
      Feed continuous learning back into patterns, prompts, and policies.

  - id: always-continuous
    directive: >
      Keep HCFullPipeline running as the default engine for everything.
      For every change, create or attach to an HCFullPipeline run. Idle
      periods run optimization and learning pipelines. Make Arena Mode
      the default review path. Code, patterns, prompts, and policies all
      evolve through HCFullPipeline + Arena, not ad-hoc changes.
